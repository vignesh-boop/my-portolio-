Your HTML code appears to be for a portfolio website showcasing your skills as a full-stack developer, web designer, UI/UX designer, and Photoshop editor. Here's a description of your portfolio's structure and its key components:

---

**Portfolio Website Structure:**

1. **Header & Meta Information:**
   - The `<head>` section includes metadata and links to external CSS files (`globals.css` and `style.css`) for styling purposes.

2. **Main Portfolio Section:**
   - The main content of the portfolio is wrapped in a `div` with the class `portfolio`.

3. **About Section:**
   - Inside the `div` with class `about`, you have:
     - A circular visual element (`about-circle-with`).
     - "About Me" heading followed by a description of you as a "Full Stack Developer."
     - A "See More" button styled with background images (`rectangle-1-4.svg` and `rectangle-2-4.svg`).
     - Placeholder text for additional information or description.

4. **Learned Skills Section:**
   - This section highlights your various skills, such as:
     - UI/UX Designer
     - Web Designer
     - Photoshop Editor (PS-Editor)
   - Each skill has a short description and a "Read More" button for further details.

5. **Projects Section:**
   - The projects section showcases your completed web design projects with images and descriptions. Placeholder text has been used for project descriptions.

6. **Contact Me Section:**
   - This section allows users to fill out a form with fields for first name, last name, email, phone number, and a message. These fields are currently placeholders but are visually structured for potential form submissions.

7. **Navigation Menu:**
   - A navigation bar is included at the bottom with links to different sections such as:
     - Home
     - About
     - Skills
     - Projects
     - Contact
   - These links are styled as buttons using images and text.

8. **Styling & Visuals:**
   - Various images are included to style buttons, icons, and other elements (`rectangle`, `ellipse`, `icons`, etc.). The layout seems highly visual and interactive with buttons and elements spread throughout the page.
   - The overall structure is visually rich, with overlapping `div`s and CSS background images, giving a dynamic look to the portfolio.

**Next Steps & Suggestions:**
1. **Content Enhancements:**
   - Replace placeholder texts like "text formatt it will been initial for the corrept" with actual descriptions of your skills, experience, and projects.
   - Add links to live projects or GitHub repositories where relevant.

2. **Form Functionality:**
   - Implement form handling so that visitors can contact you by submitting the form. This can be done by connecting the form fields to a backend service or email handler.

3. **Improve Navigation:**
   - Ensure the navigation buttons are linked to the appropriate sections of the page for smooth scrolling.

4. **Optimize for Responsiveness:**
   - Make sure the design looks good on various screen sizes, as a portfolio should be mobile-friendly.

This CSS defines the layout and styling for a portfolio page. Here's a breakdown of its structure:

- **General Layout:**
  - `.portfolio`: A container that holds the entire portfolio, uses `flex` to align child elements horizontally (`flex-direction: row`) and center them.
  - `.div`: A large container with a fixed width and height, representing the main content section.
  - Multiple `.overlap` classes are used to position elements absolutely within the layout, often overlapping each other.

- **About Section:**
  - `.about`: A section positioned at the top, with a dark background (`#101617`), representing an introduction or "about me" area.
  - `.about-circle-with`: A circular element with a border and blur effect, creating a visually interesting design element.
  - `.about-me`: Styles the heading "About Me" using a custom font and transparent color.

- **Text Styling:**
  - `.text-wrapper` and `.text-wrapper-2`: These classes define the color of text content.
  - `.full-stack-developer`: Centers and styles text describing the user's role, like "Full Stack Developer."
  
- **Button and CV Download:**
  - `.dounload`: Styles a button for downloading a CV, which is positioned absolutely and styled with rounded corners and borders.
  - `.download-CV`: A label inside the button prompting users to download the CV.

- **Skills and Other Sections:**
  - `.LEARNED-SKILLS`: Styles a section that lists the skills learned, prominently positioned in the layout.
  - Other sections like `.component`, `.frame`, `.overlap-wrapper` help organize additional content areas, like showcasing specific projects or experience.

- **UI Elements:**
  - Many elements like `.about-circle-with-2`, `.component-2`, `.overlap-5` are decorative and help structure the visual flow of the page.
  
This CSS is part of a larger design for a portfolio page, focusing on bold colors, precise layouts, and strong typographic elements to highlight key sections such as skills, CV download, and about me sections.
